# Advanced Traffic Accident Prediction and Risk Analysis System

This project demonstrates how to use the Abu Dhabi Traffic Accident Reports dataset (2025) for predicting traffic accident hotspots and analyzing risk factors. The system leverages machine learning and geospatial analysis to provide actionable insights for traffic authorities, urban planners, and policymakers.

## Features
1. **Accident Hotspot Detection**: Clustering analysis to identify accident-prone zones.
2. **Predictive Modeling**: Machine learning models to predict accident severity based on conditions.
3. **Interactive Visualization**: Maps to visualize hotspots and patterns.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Folium

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/traffic-accident-analysis.git
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   bash
   cd traffic-accident-analysis
   
3. Install required packages:
   bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   

## Usage
1. Place the dataset (`Traffic_Accident_2025.csv`) in the project directory.
2. Run the script:
   bash
   python traffic_analysis.py
   
3. View the generated hotspot map (`hotspots_map.html`) in your browser.

## Results
- Interactive map highlighting accident hotspots.
- Predictive model accuracy displayed in the console.
